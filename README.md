# Todo List

This is a Todo List application based on HTML, CSS and Javascript (Node JS and Express JS)

You will find that I have worked with fetch API  and used express extensively.  Also furtherdown I will be adding NoSQL Database MongoDB into this project.

The main resources I haved used is :
* Net ninja NodeJS Tutorials (have used additional updated resources)
* Stackoverflow
* GeeksforGeeks
* (And a couple of other references)
