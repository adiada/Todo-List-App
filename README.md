# Todo List

This is a Todo List application based on EJS,HTML, CSS and Javascript (Node JS and Express JS)

You will find that I have worked with fetch API  and used express extensively.  Also I have included the document database MongoDB using MongoDB atlas for processing(crud) the data. We are using the MVC(Model View Controller) Approach for designing this application.

I have hidden the mongodb connection string for security purposes. However you are free to subtitute the same with your corresponding mongodb URI.

There is an api endpoint available at 'localhost:3000/api/todolist' for getting all the details of the data. 

The main resources I haved used is :
* Net ninja NodeJS Tutorials (have used additional updated resources)
* Stackoverflow
* GeeksforGeeks
* (And a couple of other references)
